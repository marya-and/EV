# EV
This app is a full end‑to‑end data science project for EV battery health.

You can:

Work with 3 built‑in synthetic datasets: Urban, Highway, Mixed.
Upload multiple CSV files → each becomes Upload_1, Upload_2, etc.
Analyse them individually, side‑by‑side, or all combined.
We intentionally include:

Missing data (MCAR + MAR)
Feature engineering (thermal, energy, stress)
Encoding (numeric, categorical, text → TF‑IDF)
Classical models (Linear Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
Advanced models (deep neural network MLP, XGBoost when available)
Time series forecasting (AutoReg SOH)
Rich visualizations: histograms, box/violin, scatter, 3D scatter, scatter matrix, PCA, correlation & missingness heatmaps, etc.
Each tab matches the course topics (IDA/EDA, Missingness, Encoding, Regression, SVD/PCA, Time Series, NLP) and the final project rubric.
